Stemming Algorithm<br>
Stemming is the algorithmic process of reducing a word to its stem, root, or base form. A stemming algorithm usually employs the simplistic process of lopping off the endings of a word. For example, a stemming algorithm might reduce the words "dogs," "dogfish," and "dogfood" to the word "dog."
